## [1.0.9] - 2022-09-20
### Added
- Logger callback to initialize function. This enables users of the SDK to specify where logs generated by the SDK are output, and to silence logs by not specifying a logger callback.
- New attributes to the `Credential` model. `Tenant` now has a `displayName` and `Identity` contains a `primaryEmailAddress`.
### Changed
- Replaced existing `authenticate` function with one that now takes two arguments, `url`and `credentialID`. This is now inline with how consumers of the SDK have been using this function.
### Removed
- Optimizely dependency. There will no longer be an error displayed in the console related to Optimizely whenever the SDK is initialized.
### Fixed
- The SDK no longer bundles modules as `eval(...)` expressions, rather minified JS.
